This case is a restart from a previous CFmesh from Fernando Miro Miro. 

The shock refinement works with two regions: (1st) close to the nose, where it refines
around a parabola, and then (2nd) farther downstream, where it refines around a
constant ray:
1 The parabola can be fitted onto a series of arbitrary points, but it remains a
parabola. The extracted shock position points that you gave me (because of the
chemistry) are not exactly in a parabola, so the fitted parabola is quite different
from the original shock points.
2 The ray is taken at the infinitely sharp taylor-maccoll shock angle. However this
equation is solved in perfect-gas conditions, not in LTE, so the angle can
change substantially.
In short, the shock refinement is tailored for perfect-gas flows, where the nose shock is
parabolic, and where the downstream shock satisfies perfect-gas taylor-maccoll.
