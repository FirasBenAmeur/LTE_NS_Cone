In these executions we use the high order reconstruction to the CCFVM that approximate each cells with a piecewise polynomial of degree 1
instead of a constant (CCFVM classic). This method based on a more general class of methods called the discontinuous
Galerkin method increases the accuracy of the scheme in space. 

CCFVM accuracy -> O(h)
CCFVM with high order reconstruction -> O(h^2)

This change has an impact on the solution. For the simulation of compressible flows, we tend to have oscillations near discontinuities 
(shock waves, contact surface between each cells) -> Gibbs phenomenon

In order to prevent these oscillations, in each cell, the approximate piecewise polynomial is modified [p122 Lani's thesis]
by adding a facteur called the flux limiter.

(In practice, when the convergence rate start to oscillate arround the same value, we freeze the limiter )
