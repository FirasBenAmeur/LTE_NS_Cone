 We're currently:
  - trying to improve the convergence of the CFcase by building a function for 
    the CFL --> unrefined mesh 10K elements 
  
  - running the CFcase on the  unrefined mesh of 500K elements --> IT TAKES TIME...
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*


After all the updates*** (for more details see down below ___), the current CFcase seems to work correctly.

We manage to converge (with the unrefined mesh of 10K elements) :

- in 1rst order accuracy (classic CCFVM) : 
>> Result path: LTE_NS_Cone/RESULTS/T_residue_CCFVM_1srt_order_accuracy


- in 2nd order accuracy (with high order reconstruction)
>> Result path: LTE_NS_Cone/RESULTS/T_residue_CCFVM_with_high_order_reconstruction

1) we restarted  a converged solution from an old CFcase (sent by Miro Miro). The mesh had an issue. 
   It was not refined around the shock because the shock refinement was tailored for a perfect gas 
   flow (we are here in LTE assumptions) where the nose shock was parabolic, and where the downstream 
   shock satisfies the Taylor Maccoll condition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) With unrefined meshes, we started from scratch 
   >> Gambit files in: LTE_NS_Cone/tree/master/Empty_Unrefined_Meshes
   For the convective space discretisation of the NS equations, we tried different ways to compute the
   speed of the sound in the interfaces of each cells. To see the impact on the behaviour of the temperature
   residu.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) When we tried to converge in 2nd order accuracy, we encountered many issues. The reason was the missing
   lines about the nodal extrapolation which allows computing the pressure and the gradient pressure of the
   diffusion's term in the NS equations [p126 Lani's thesis]
   We start over the number 2) step to compare the convergence by adding the nodal extrapolation
   >> Results in: LTE_NS_Cone/RESULTS/T_residue_CCFVM_1srt_order_accuracy/WITH_Nodal_Extrapolation/Non_adiabatic/
   The temperature residue seemed correct, but then by having a look at the solution, we realized that the shock
   wave didn't detach from the nose. 
   >> Result in: LTE_NS_Cone/RESULTS/T_residue_CCFVM_1srt_order_accuracy/WITH_Nodal_Extrapolation/Non_adiabatic/ISSUE_sol.png
   To detach the solution, the trick is to run in an adiabatic state for some iterations and then pass to nonadiabatic. 
   In the interfile, we were using the wrong function (DistanceBasedGMoveRhoivt instead of DistanceBasedGMove). 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 4) After the modifications, we started over the convergence in 1rst order of accuracy. 
    >> Results in : LTE_NS_Cone/RESULTS/T_residue_CCFVM_1srt_order_accuracy/WITH_Nodal_Extrapolation/NbiterAdiabatic_3000/
    The best choice for the convective speed of sound computation seemed to be the ChoiceA12 = 2. 
    That is why we ran the cases in 2nd order of accuracy with this choice. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 5) In the second order, we tried three different ways to reach the convergence to compare which one was the faster.
    Results in: LTE_NS_Cone/RESULTS/T_residue_CCFVM_with_high_order_reconstruction/
    observation: It seems to be better to converge entirely in 1srt order accuracy before using the high order reconstruction 
    (16000 iters vs. ~= 20000 for the other attempts)
