AMRI'S notes :
--------------

OBSERVATION : 
After the add of the nodal extrapolation in the CFcase, I start from scratch
with the different AUSM choiceA12 to see how it will affects the convergence of the temperature residue.

--> See: LTE_NS_Cone/RESULTS/FirstOrder_CCFVM/WITH_Nodal_Extrapolation/

But then I realized that the solutions obtained (with or without nodal extrapolation) have an issue. 
The shock doesn't seems to detache completely.

In the inter file,
The following line seems to do nothing because we are in PUVT...

>> Simulator.SubSystem.CellCenterFVM.Data.DistanceBasedGMoveRhoivt.NbIterAdiabatic = 3000

We replaced it by : 
Simulator.SubSystem.CellCenterFVM.Data.DistanceBasedGMove.NbIterAdiabatic = 3000

It is currently running... We will see how it affects the solution.
