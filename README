AMRI'S notes :
--------------

After all the updates***, the current CFcase seems to work correctly.

We manage to converge :

- in 1rst order accuracy (classic CCFVM) : 
>> Result path: https://github.com/SanaAmri/LTE_NS_Cone/tree/master/RESULTS/T_residue_CCFVM_1srt_order_accuracy


- in 2nd order accuracy (with high order reconstruction)
>> Result path: https://github.com/SanaAmri/LTE_NS_Cone/tree/master/RESULTS/T_residue_CCFVM_with_high_order_reconstruction


(We're currently trying to run the CFcase on the bigger mesh -> 500K elements)

*** 
1) we restarted  a converged solution from an old CFcase (sent by Miro Miro). The mesh had an issue. It was not refined arround the shock
 because the shock refinement was tailored for a perfect gaz flow (we are here in LTE assumptions) where the nose shock was parabolic, 
 and where the downstream shock statisfies the Taylor Maccoll condition.

2) With unrefined meshes, with started from scratch

   For the convective space discretisation of the NS equations, we tried different ways to compute the speed of the sound in the interfaces
   of each cells. To see the impact on the behaviour of the temperature residu.

3) When we tried to converge in 2nd order accuracy, we encountered many issues. The reason was the missing line about the nodal 
   extrapolation which allows to compute the pressure and the gradient pressure of the diffusion term in the NS equations [p126 Lani's thesis]
